# When to use ?

Use it at the end of the training as a way of concluding this journey. This is a key moment of the training, making the collective feel like they went through a journey together, and giving them the occasion to reflect on what they learned.

# Description

## Option 1 : What did others learn ? (20/30min)

The participants (including the trainer) stand up and move randomly in the room until you give them the signal to stop. When you do, they partner up with the closest person. If you don’t have enough space for that, you can simply draw random numbers (with each number written twice in the pool) and people team up with the person having the same. You could also make them pair with the person at their left and then at their right. They can then share with each other their answer to the following questions :

1. What would be one thing that you learned ?
2. What would be one thing that you felt ?
3. What would be one thing that will change in your work ?

Repeat this up to 4 times and then get the participants back in circle. Each one can then share something that someone told them during the exercise, without naming who.

For example, a sentence could be : “Someone told me they felt ashamed of knowing so little about accessibility, but eager to try their best to get the app to be more accessible.”

## Option 2 : Together on a boat (10/15min)

This version has significantly less collective building effect than the first variation but works well as an alternative when you are behind schedule or in a context where people cannot move in the room (for example in a video-conference context).

Each participant (including the trainer) gets a copy of the boat drawing found in the resources. Then, everybody takes turn explaining which character they felt like at the beginning of the formation, and which one they feel like now. This is the occasion for every participant to reflect on how this experience affected themselves and others around !

# Resources
