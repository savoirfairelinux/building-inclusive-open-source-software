## Testing softwares

### Wave

We already covered Wave in the [🔧 Assistive technologies : Desktop](A-ITD.md) module. [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) is a testing software to automatically detect warnings and errors related to the [WCAG Accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). It’s as simple as entering your domain to see prevalent issues with your website.

While you might be working on a native app, it’s very likely that you or your organization have a website along with it. Wave is a very convenient way to check if you’re also up to date on that end without necessitating further knowledge.

Still be careful not to believe blindly the feedback form automated tools lke Wave. **It will often make mistakes** and is not a substitute for *savoir-faire* in any way.

### Lighthouse

[Lighthouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools/lighthouse/lighthouse-tool?source=recommendations) is a web accessibility testing software developed by Microsoft and integrated inside of Microsoft Edge. It works very similarly to wave.

### Axe

Axe DevTools is one of the most used web accessibility tool with over two billion downloads. It's developed and maintained by Deque which are behind the accessibility of some of the biggest companies worldwide. It's feedback is very comprehensible, providing insights on how to fix specific issues and even providing information about "Best Practices".
