# When to use ?

This is the penultimate module of this formation on inclusive design and programming. It creates the space for the trained team(s) to think about the ways they can make their app more inclusive.

# Description

## Option 1 : What did others learn ? (20/30min)

Create different groups based on the platforms people are working on and/or if they are rather on the side of product management, development, design or something else - any criteria works best for the trained organization or team. 

Each group starts by listing the obvious inclusiveness flaws in their field, how they can address them, and the ways they can discover more. Then, each group can choose or elect someone to open the issues for each platform right after the meeting. 

This person will be the “inclusiveness coach” of their group for the following weeks. That doesn’t mean that they will fix those issues themselves but rather that they will keep track of the updates on the topic, for example by following up with developers to see how the implementation of those features are going.

Once every group has finished this process, they are given the opportunity to explain briefly to the others what there inclusiveness roadmap will be and who is the “coach” in their group. This will help communication between teams as other employees will know who to refer to talk about inclusiveness.
